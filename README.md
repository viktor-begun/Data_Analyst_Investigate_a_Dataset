# Title of the Project: Demographic transition in Russia

**Purpose:** investigate a large freely available dataset and go through all typical analysis stages. Namely, state some clear questions, clean the dataset, explore the data, document all steps , find the answers, use at least two type of visualisations, communicate the findings, explain the limitattions of the analysis and of the conclusions.

The [**Gapminder World**](https://www.gapminder.org/data/) dataset is selected. 

### The questions to investigate:
1. When Russians changed their reproductive behavior and decided to have smaller number of children? 
2. How fast the transition happened? 
3. Does the transition correlate with any possibly related indicator?

### Conclusions:
1. The analysed data suggest that demographic transition in Russia occured in three stages.
  - First, the transition from the 'traditional' family with 6-7 children, from which, however, only 3 survived up to the age of 35, to the family with 2-3 children, from which everyone survived.

  - Second, the transition to the family with mostly 2 children.

  - Third, the transition to the family with mostly 1 child.

2. The transitions seem to happen between 1920 and 1955, between 1960 and 1965, and between 1990 and 1995 years.

3. The anti-correlation between the rate of abortions and the GDP per capita appeares since 1965, and increases after that time.


The interpretation of the obtained results should be done with care because of the limitations of methods and assumptions that were done. Namely, the conclusions are made about private life, but based on global indicators. The data on abortions are absend before 1960. The aging and migrations of the population were not included into the analysis.
