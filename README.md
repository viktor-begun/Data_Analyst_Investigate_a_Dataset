# Demographic transition in Russia.

This is the second project at **Udacity**. The **purpose** is to **investigate** a large freely available **dataset**. The [Gapminder World](https://www.gapminder.org/data/) dataset is selected. 

The questions to investigate: 
1. When Russians changed their reproductive behavior and decided to have smaller number of children? 
2. How fast the transition happened? 
3. Does the transition correlate with any possibly related indicator?
